# BUBBLE

### Description

A simple bubble game, click on any bubble to pop it and all nearby bubbles of same color. The rest of bubbles fall down to fill the void 'popped' bubbles created.

The concept is similar to games like [Collapse!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse!) or [SameGame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SameGame).
